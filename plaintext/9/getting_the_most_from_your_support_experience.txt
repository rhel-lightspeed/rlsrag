Chapter 1. Generating an sos report for technical support
With the sos utility, you can collect configuration, diagnostic, and troubleshooting data, and provide those files to Red Hat Technical Support.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.1. What the sos utility does
An sos report is a common starting point for Red Hat technical support engineers when performing analysis of a service request for a RHEL system. The sos utility (also known as sosreport) provides a standardized way to collect diagnostic information that Red Hat support engineers can reference throughout their investigation of issues reported in support cases. Using the sos utility helps to ensure that you are not repeatedly asked for data output.
The sos utility allows to collect various debugging information from one or more systems, optionally clean sensitive data, and upload it in a form of a report to Red Hat. More specifically, the three sos components do the following:
sos report collects debugging information from one system.
sos collect allows to run and collect individual sos reports from a specified set of nodes.
sos clean obfuscates potentially sensitive information such as user names, host names, IP or MAC addresses, or other user-specified data.
The information collected in a report contains configuration details, system information, and diagnostic information from a RHEL system, such as:
The running kernel version.
Loaded kernel modules.
System and service configuration files.
Diagnostic command output.
A list of installed packages.
The sos utility writes the data it collects to an archive named sosreport-<host_name>-<support_case_number>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<unique_random_characters>.tar.xz.
The utility stores the archive and its SHA-256 checksum in the /var/tmp/ directory:

1.4. Generating and collecting sos reports on multiple systems concurrently
You can use the sos utility to trigger the sos report command on multiple systems. Wait for the report to terminate and collect all generated reports.
Prerequisites
You know the cluster type or list of nodes to run on.
You have installed the sos package on all systems.
You have ssh keys for the root account on all the systems, or you can provide the root password via the --password option.
Procedure
Run the sos collect command and follow the on-screen instructions.
You can set the cluster or nodes types manually with the --cluster or --nodes options.
You can also use the --master option to point the sos utility at a remote node to determine the cluster type and the node lists. Thus, you do not have to be logged into one of the cluster nodes to collect sos reports; you can do it from your workstation.
You can add the --upload option to transfer the sos report to Red Hat immediately after generating it.
Any valid sos report option can be further supplied and will be passed to all sos reports executions, such as the --batch and --clean options.
[root@primary-rhel9 ~]# sos collect --nodes=sos-node1,sos-node2 -o process,apache --log-size=50

sos-collector (version 4.2)

This utility is used to collect sosreports from multiple nodes simultaneously.
It uses OpenSSH's ControlPersist feature to connect to nodes and run commands remotely. If your system installation of OpenSSH is older than 5.6, please upgrade.

An archive of sosreport tarballs collected from the nodes will be generated in /var/tmp/sos.o4l55n1s and may be provided to an appropriate support representative.

The generated archive may contain data considered sensitive and its content should be reviewed by the originating organization before being passed to any third party.

No configuration changes will be made to the system running this utility or remote systems that it connects to.


Press ENTER to continue, or CTRL-C to quit


Please enter the case id you are collecting reports for: <8-digit_case_number>

sos-collector ASSUMES that SSH keys are installed on all nodes unless the
--password option is provided.

The following is a list of nodes to collect from:
    primary-rhel9
    sos-node1
    sos-node2


Press ENTER to continue with these nodes, or press CTRL-C to quit

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.5. Cleaning an sos report
The sos utility offers a routine to obfuscate potentially sensitive data, such as user names, host names, IP or MAC addresses, or other user-specified keywords. The original sos report or sos collect stays unchanged, and a new *-obfuscated.tar.xz file is generated and intended to be shared with a third party.
Prerequisites
You have generated an sos report or an sos collect tarball.
(Optional) You have a list of specific keywords beyond the user names, host names, and other data you want to obfuscate.
Procedure
Run the sos clean command on either an sos report or sos collect tarball and follow the on-screen instructions.
You can add the --keywords option to additionally clean a given list of keywords.
You can add the --usernames option to obfuscate further sensitive user names.
The automatic user name cleaning will automatically run for users reported through the lastlog file for users with an UID of 1000 and above. This option is used for LDAP users that may not appear as an actual login, but may occur in certain log files.
[user@server1 ~]$ sudo sos clean /var/tmp/sos-collector-2022-05-15-pafsr.tar.xz
[sudo] password for user:

sos clean (version 4.2)

This command will attempt to obfuscate information that is generally considered to be potentially sensitive. Such information includes IP addresses, MAC addresses, domain names, and any user-provided keywords.

Note that this utility provides a best-effort approach to data obfuscation, but it does not guarantee that such obfuscation provides complete coverage of all such data in the archive, or that any obfuscation is provided to data that does not fit the description above.

Users should review any resulting data and/or archives generated or processed by this utility for remaining sensitive content before being passed to a third party.


Press ENTER to continue, or CTRL-C to quit.

1.8. Creating a GPG2 key
The following procedure describes how to generate a GPG2 key to use with encryption utilities.
Prerequisites
You need root privileges.
Procedure
Install and configure the pinentry utility.
[root@server ~]# dnf install pinentry
[root@server ~]# mkdir ~/.gnupg -m 700
[root@server ~]# echo "pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
Create a key-input file used for generating a GPG keypair with your preferred details. For example:
[root@server ~]# cat >key-input <<EOF
%echo Generating a standard key
Key-Type: RSA
Key-Length: 2048
Name-Real: GPG User
Name-Comment: first key
Name-Email: root@example.com
Expire-Date: 0
%commit
%echo Finished creating standard key
EOF
(Optional) By default, GPG2 stores its keyring in the ~/.gnupg file. To use a custom keyring location, set the GNUPGHOME environment variable to a directory that is only accessible by root.
[root@server ~]# export GNUPGHOME=/root/backup

[root@server ~]# mkdir -p $GNUPGHOME -m 700
Generate a new GPG2 key based on the contents of the key-input file.

1.9. Generating an sos report from the rescue environment
If a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) host does not boot properly, you can boot the host into a rescue environment to gather an sos report.
Using the rescue environment, you can mount the target system under /mnt/sysroot, access its contents, and run the sos report command.
Prerequisites
If the host is a bare metal server, you need physical access to the machine.
If the host is a virtual machine, you need access to the virtual machine’s settings in the hypervisor.
A RHEL installation source, such as an ISO image file, an installation DVD, a netboot CD, or a Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) configuration providing a RHEL installation tree.
Procedure
Boot the host from an installation source.
In the boot menu for the installation media, select the Troubleshooting option.
In the Troubleshooting menu, select the Rescue a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system option.
At the Rescue menu, select 1 and press the Enter key to continue and mount the system under the /mnt/sysroot directory.
Press the Enter key to obtain a shell when prompted.
Use the chroot command to change the apparent root directory of the rescue session to the /mnt/sysroot directory.
Optional: Your network might not be up in the inital Rescue Environment, so make sure you set it up first. For example, if the network requires static IP addresses, and you want to transfer the sos report over the network, configure the network:
Identify the Ethernet device you want to use:
# ip link show
…​
2: enp1s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 52:54:00:74:79:56 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
Assign an IP address to the network interface, and set the default gateway. For example, if you wanted to add the IP address of 192.168.0.1 with a subnet of 255.255.255.0, which is a CIDR of 24, to device enp1s0, enter:
# ip address add <192.168.0.1/24> dev <enp1s0>
# ip route add default via <192.168.0.254>
Add a nameserver entry to the /etc/resolv.conf file, for example:
# nameserver <192.168.0.5>
Run the sos report command and follow the on-screen instructions. You can add the --upload option to transfer the sos report to Red Hat immediately after generating it.
Optional: If you have already opened a Technical Support case with Red Hat, enter the case number to embed it in the sos report file name, and it will be uploaded to that case if you specified the --upload option and your host is connected to the internet. If you do not have a case number, leave this field blank. Entering a case number is optional and does not affect the operation of the sos utility.
Take note of the sos report file name displayed at the end of the console output.
If your host does not have a connection to the internet, use a file transfer utility such as scp to transfer the sos report to another host on your network, then upload it to a Red Hat Technical Support case.
Verification steps
Verify that the sos utility created an archive in the /var/tmp/ directory.
