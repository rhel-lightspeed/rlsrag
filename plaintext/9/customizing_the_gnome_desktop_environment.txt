Preface
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 1. Enabling desktop icons
You can enable the desktop icons functionality and move files to the desktop.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.1. Desktop icons in RHEL 9
Desktop icons are provided by the Desktop icons GNOME Shell extension, which is available from the gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons package.
Desktop icons in GNOME Classic
The GNOME Classic environment includes the gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons package by default. Desktop icons are always on, and you cannot turn them off.
Desktop icons in GNOME Standard
In GNOME Standard, desktop icons are disabled by default.
To enable desktop icons in the GNOME Standard environment, you must install the gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons package.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.2. Enabling desktop icons in GNOME Standard
This procedure enables the desktop icons functionality in the GNOME Standard environment.
Prerequisites
The Extensions application is installed on the system:
# dnf install gnome-shell-extension-desktop-icons
Procedure
Open the Extensions application.
Enable the Desktop Icons extension.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.3. Creating a desktop icon for a file
This procedure creates a desktop icon for an existing file.
Prerequisites
The Desktop icons extension is enabled.
Procedure
Move the selected file into the ~/Desktop/ directory.
Verification steps
Check that the icon for the file appears on the desktop.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 2. Setting up startup applications in GNOME
In the GNOME desktop environment, you can add applications to start automatically upon logging in, meaning that the application launches automatically every time you log into your GNOME desktop session.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2.1. Launching an application automatically on login
You can set applications to launch automatically on login using the Tweaks tool. Tweaks is a tool to customize the GNOME Shell environment for a particular user.
Prerequisites
You have installed gnome-tweaks on your system. For more details, see Installing software in GNOME
You have installed the application that you want to launch at login.
Procedure

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2.2. Enabling startup applications for another user in GNOME
You can set up a startup application to run for specific users on a system. This will automatically start the specified application for the target user when they log in.
Prerequisites
Administrative access.
Procedure
Locate the .desktop file in the /usr/share/applications/ directory that corresponds to the application you want to start automatically.
As the root user, copy the .desktop file to the /home/<targetuser>/.config/autostart/ directory:
# cp /usr/share/applications/<yourapp>.desktop /home/<targetuser>/.config/autostart/
Replace <yourapp> with the name of your application. Replace <targetuser> with the username.
Ensure that the .desktop file is owned by the target user and has the correct permissions:
# chown <targetuser>:<targetuser> /home/<targetuser>/.config/autostart/<yourapp>.desktop
# chmod 644 /home/<targetuser>/.config/autostart/<yourapp>.desktop
Replace <targetuser> with the username. Replace <yourapp>.desktop with the .desktop file you copied.
Verification
The target user should log out of their GNOME session and log back in. The application specified in the .desktop file should start automatically.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2.3. Enabling system-wide startup applications for all users in GNOME
You can set up a startup application to run for all users on a system by placing the .desktop file in a system-wide directory that is accessible to all users. This will automatically start the specified application for every user who logs in.
Prerequisites
Administrative access.
Procedure
Locate the .desktop file in the /usr/share/applications/ directory that corresponds to the application you want to start automatically.
As the root user, copy the .desktop file to the /etc/xdg/autostart/ directory:
# cp /usr/share/applications/<yourapp>.desktop /etc/xdg/autostart/
Replace <yourapp> with the name of your application.
Ensure that the .desktop file has the correct permissions to be read by all users:
# chmod 644 /etc/xdg/autostart/<yourapp>.desktop
Replace <yourapp>.desktop with the .desktop file you copied.
Verification
Users on the system should log out of their sessions and log back in. The application specified in the system-wide .desktop file should start automatically.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 3. Enabling automatic login
You can enable automatic login in order to streamline your computing experience, avoiding the need to repeatedly enter your password during every session startup. This can be convenient for single-user environments where security risks are minimal, such as on a personal home computer that is not shared with others.
Procedure
Open Settings.
Click Users.
Select the Unlock button and enter your password.
Toggle the switch to enable automatic login.
Once you have enabled automatic login, your computer will automatically log in to the specified user account the next time you start it up.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 4. Enabling automatic suspension
Enabling automatic suspension provides benefits in terms of energy conservation by ensuring that your system goes into a lower power state after a period of inactivity. This feature helps reduce power consumption when your computer is not in use, potentially prolonging the battery life of your device.
Procedure
Open Settings.
Click Power.
Choose Automatic Suspend.
Toggle the switch to enable automatic logout.
Set the desired time interval for automatic logout after inactivity.
This interval defines how long your system remains idle before automatically logging you out.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 5. Enabling automatic screen lock
Enabling automatic screen lock is a security measure that helps protect your computer when it is left unattended. This feature ensures that your screen is locked after a specified period of inactivity, requiring a password or authentication to regain access.
Procedure
Open Settings.
Click Privacy.
Choose Screen Lock.
Toggle the switch to enable automatic screen lock.
Set the desired time interval for automatic screen lock delay.
This interval defines how long your screen stays active after itthe screen is automatically locked.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 6. Changing how your system behaves when you close the laptop lid
When you close the lid of your laptop, it suspends by default to save battery. You can customize this behavior according to your preferences.
Prerequisites
Administrative access.
Procedure
Open the /etc/systemd/logind.conf configuration file.
Look for the line that says HandleLidSwitch=suspend.
If the line starts with the # symbol, remove it to enable the setting.
Replace suspend with one of the following options:
poweroff to shut down the computer.
lock to lock the screen.
ignore to do nothing.
For example, to lock the screen upon closing the lid, use this setting:
HandleLidSwitch=lock
Save your changes and close the editor.

Chapter 7. Customizing desktop appearance and branding
As a system administrator, you can configure the default appearance and branding of the GNOME interface for all users on the system.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7.1. Customizing desktop backgrounds
As a system administrator, you can configure the default desktop background, add extra backgrounds, or add multiple backgrounds available to all users of the system.
If the users are not permitted to change background from the defaults, you must lock the settings using the locks directory. Otherwise, each user can customize the background according to their preferences.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7.1.1. Customizing the default desktop background
You can configure the default desktop background and its appearance by setting the relevant GSettings keys in the org.gnome.desktop.background schema.
Procedure
Create a local database for machine-wide settings in /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-background:
[org/gnome/desktop/background]

picture-uri='file:///usr/local/share/backgrounds/wallpaper.jpg' 1
picture-options='scaled' 2
primary-color='000000' 3
secondary-color='FFFFFF' 4
Optional: If you want to prevent a user from changing the default background, override the user’s setting in the /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/background file:
# List the keys used to configure the desktop background
/org/gnome/desktop/background/picture-uri
/org/gnome/desktop/background/picture-options
/org/gnome/desktop/background/primary-color
/org/gnome/desktop/background/secondary-color
Update the system databases:
# dconf update
Users must log out and back in again before the system-wide settings take effect.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7.1.2. Adding extra backgrounds
You can make extra backgrounds available to users on your system.
Procedure
Create the /usr/share/gnome-background-properties/extra-backgrounds.xml file.
In the new file, specify the extra background files and their appearance in the following format:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE wallpapers SYSTEM "gnome-wp-list.dtd">
<wallpapers>
  <wallpaper deleted="false">
    <name>Background name</name>

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 10. Restricting the session to a single application
You can start the GNOME session in single-application mode, also known as kiosk mode. In this session, GNOME displays only a full-screen window of the application that you have selected.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
10.1. Single-application mode
Single-application mode is a modified GNOME session that reconfigures the Mutter window manager into an interactive kiosk. This session locks down certain behavior to make the standard desktop more restrictive. The user can interact only with a single application selected by the administrator.
You can set up single-application mode for several use cases, such as:
In the communication, entertainment, or education fields
As a self-serve machine
As an event manager
As a registration point
The GNOME Kiosk utility provides the single-application mode configuration and sessions.
The following single-application sessions are available:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 12. Displaying the system security classification
As an administrator of deployments where the user must be aware of the security classification of the system, you can set up a notification of the security classification. This can be either a permanent banner or a temporary notification, and it can appear on login screen, in the GNOME session, and on the lock screen.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
12.1. Enabling system security classification banners
You can create a permanent classification banner to state the overall security classification level of the system. This is useful for deployments where the user must always be aware of the security classification level of the system that they are logged into.
The permanent classification banner can appear within the running session, the lock screen, and login screen, and customize its background color, its font, and its position within the screen.
This procedure creates a red banner with a white text placed on both the top and bottom of the login screen.
Procedure
Install the gnome-shell-extension-classification-banner package:
# dnf install gnome-shell-extension-classification-banner
Create the 99-class-banner file at either of the following locations:
To configure a notification at the login screen, create /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/99-class-banner.
To configure a notification in the user session, create /etc/dconf/db/local.d/99-class-banner.
Enter the following configuration in the created file:
[org/gnome/shell]
enabled-extensions=['classification-banner@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com']

[org/gnome/shell/extensions/classification-banner]
background-color='rgba(200,16,46,0.75)'
message='TOP SECRET'
top-banner=true
bottom-banner=true
system-info=true
color='rgb(255,255,255)'
Update the dconf database:
# dconf update
Reboot the system.
Troubleshooting
If the classification banners are not displayed for an existing user, log in as the user and enable the Classification banner extension using the Extensions application.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
12.2. Notifying of the system security classification
You can set up a notification that contains a predefined message in an overlay banner. This is useful for deployments where the user is required to read the security classification of the system before logging in.
Depending on your configuration, the notification can appear at the login screen, after logging in, on the lock screen, or after a longer time with no user activity. You can always dismiss the notification when it appears.
Procedure
Install the gnome-shell-extension-heads-up-display package:
# dnf install gnome-shell-extension-heads-up-display
Create the 99-hud-message file at either of the following locations:
To configure a notification at the login screen, create /etc/dconf/db/gdm.d/99-hud-message.
To configure a notification in the user session, create /etc/dconf/db/local.d/99-hud-message.
Enter the following configuration in the created file:
[org/gnome/shell]
enabled-extensions=['heads-up-display@gnome-shell-extensions.gcampax.github.com']

[org/gnome/shell/extensions/heads-up-display]
message-heading="Security classification title"
message-body="Security classification description"
# The following options control when the notification appears:
show-when-locked=true
show-when-unlocking=true
show-when-unlocked=true
Replace the following values with text that describes the security classification of your system:
Update the dconf database:
# dconf update
Reboot the system.
Troubleshooting
If the notifications are not displayed for an existing user, log in as the user and enable the Heads-up display message extension using the Extensions application.

13.4.3. Authorizing users of a Braille display device
To use a Braille display device, you must set the users who are authorized to use the Braille display device.
Procedure
In the /etc/brltty.conf file, ensure that keyfile is set to /etc/brlapi.key:
api-parameters Auth=keyfile:/etc/brlapi.key
This is the default value. Your organization might have overridden it.
Authorize the selected users by adding them to the brlapi group:
# usermod --append -G brlapi user-name

13.4.4. Setting the driver for a Braille display device
The brltty service automatically chooses a driver for your Braille display device. If the automatic detection fails or takes too long, you can set the driver manually.
Prerequisites
The automatic driver detection has failed or takes too long.
Procedure
Open the /etc/brltty.conf configuration file.
Find the braille-driver directive, which specifies the driver for your Braille display device.
Specify the identification code of the required driver in the braille-driver directive.
Choose the identification code of required driver from the list provided in /etc/brltty.conf. For example, to use the XWindow driver:
# XWindow
braille-driver	xw
To set multiple drivers, list them separated by commas. Automatic detection then chooses from the listed drivers.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
13.4.5. Connecting a Braille display device
The brltty service automatically connects to your Braille display device. If the automatic detection fails, you can set the connection method manually.
Prerequisites
The Braille display device is physically connected to your system.
The automatic connection has failed.
Procedure
If the device is connected by a serial-to-USB adapter, find the actual device name in the kernel messages on the device plug:
# journalctl --dmesg | fgrep ttyUSB
Open the /etc/brltty.conf configuration file.
Find the braille-device directive.
In the braille-device directive, specify the connection.
You can also set multiple devices, separated by commas, and each of them will be probed in turn.
For example:
Example 13.1. Settings for the first serial device
braille-device	serial:ttyS0
Example 13.2. Settings for the first USB device matching Braille driver
braille-device	usb:
Example 13.3. Settings for a specific USB device by serial number
braille-device	usb:nnnnn
Example 13.4. Settings for a serial-to-USB adapter
Use the device name that you found earlier in the kernel messages:
braille-device	serial:ttyUSB0
Example 13.5. Settings for a specific Bluetooth device by address
braille-device	bluetooth:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
13.4.6. Setting the text table
The brltty service automatically selects a text table based on your system language. If your system language does not match the language of a document that you want to read, you can set the text table manually.
Procedure
Edit the /etc/brltty.conf file.
Identify the code of your selected text table.
You can find all available text tables in the /etc/brltty/Text/ directory. The code is the file name of the text table without its file suffix.
Specify the code of the selected text table in the text-table directive.
For example, to use the text table for American English:
text-table	en_US	 # English (United States)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
13.4.7. Setting the contraction table
You can select which table is used to encode the abbreviations with a Braille display device. Relative paths to particular contraction tables are stored within the /etc/brltty/Contraction/ directory.
Procedure
Choose a contraction table from the list in the /etc/brltty.conf file.
For example, to use the contraction table for American English, grade 2:
contraction-table	en-us-g2	 # English (US, grade 2)

Chapter 14. Using special characters in GNOME
In GNOME, you can use the Compose Key to type special characters from different languages and symbol sets, including those not available on your keyboard. You can enter and view special characters from different languages and symbol sets, making it easy to work with diverse character sets in GNOME.
To input these special characters, you can define one of the existing keys on your keyboard as a Compose Key. Once enabled, the Compose Key allows you to type special characters and symbols by pressing multiple keys in a specific sequence.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
14.1. Enabling the Compose Key for an individual user
You can enable the Compose Key from the Settings menu while logged in as the user.
Procedure
Click on the Activities button in the upper-left corner of the screen.
Type Settings and click on the Settings icon to open the Settings application.
In the Settings window, click on Keyboard in the left sidebar.
Scroll down and select the Compose Key option.
Toggle the slider to enable the Compose Key.
Select the key you want to use as the Compose Key.
Once you have selected the Compose Key, close the Settings window.
Now the Compose Key is enabled, and you can use it to input special characters and symbols by pressing the Compose Key, followed by the corresponding sequence of keys.
To see available multi-key sequences for composing special characters, use:
$ grep "<Multi_key>" /usr/share/X11/locale/en_US.UTF-8/Compose
Verification
Press the Compose Key, then type the sequence of keys for the special character you want to input. For example, to type ©, press the Compose Key, then press o and c.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
14.2. Enabling the Compose Key for another user
You can enable the Compose Key for another user with the gsettings utility.
Prerequisites
Administrative access.
Procedure
Allow all clients to connect to the X server:
# xhost +
Run the following command to set the Compose Key:
# su - <username> -c "gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options \"['compose:<compose_key>']\""
Replace <username> with the username of the user for whom you want to enable the Compose Key. Replace <compose_key> with the key you want to use as the Compose Key. You can use the ralt option to designate the right Alt key as the Compose Key.
To see other Compose Key options that you can use to set up a Compose Key on your keyboard, use:
$ grep compose /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst
Resets the access control:
# xhost -
Verification
To check the Compose Key settings for another user, use:
# su - <username> -c "gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.input-sources xkb-options"
Replace <username> with the username of the user for whom you want to check the Compose Key setting.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
14.3. Enabling the Compose Key for all users
You can enable the Compose Key for all users by creating a dconf configuration file.
Prerequisites
Administrative access.
Procedure
Create the /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-compose-key configuration file with the following content:
[org/gnome/desktop/input-sources]
xkb-options=['compose:<compose_key>']
Replace <compose_key> with the key you want to use as the Compose Key. You can use the ralt option to designate the right Alt key as the Compose Key.
To see other Compose Key options that you can use to set up a Compose Key on your keyboard, use:
$ grep compose /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/evdev.lst
Update the dconf database with the new configuration:
# dconf update
Restart your system or log out and log back in to your GNOME session for the changes to take effect.
Now the Compose Key is enabled for all users on the system and they can use it to input special characters and symbols by pressing the Compose Key, followed by the corresponding sequence of keys.
Verification
Press the Compose Key, then type the sequence of keys for the special character you want to input. For example, to type ©, press the Compose Key, then press o and c.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
14.4. Compose Key sequences for special characters
The table showcases Compose Key sequences used to input special characters with diacritics or accents in GNOME. Each row displays a Compose Key sequence alongside its corresponding result

Chapter 15. Managing GNOME Shell extensions via Command Line
The gnome-extensions utility is a command-line tool that allows you to manage GNOME Shell extensions from the terminal. It provides various commands to list, install, enable, disable, remove, and get information about extensions.
Each GNOME Shell extension has a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier). You can find the UUID of an extension on its GNOME Shell Extensions website page.
Procedure
To list the installed GNOME Shell extensions, use:
$ gnome-extensions list
To install a GNOME Shell extension, use:
$ gnome-extensions install <UUID>
To enable a GNOME Shell extension, use:
$ gnome-extensions enable <UUID>
To show information about a GNOME Shell extension, use:
$ gnome-extensions info <UUID>
To disable a GNOME Shell extension, use:
$ gnome-extensions disable <UUID>
To remove a GNOME Shell extension, use:
$ gnome-extensions uninstall <UUID>
Replace the <UUIDs> with the unique identifier assigned to the GNOME Shell extension you want to install.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 16. Enabling and enforcing GNOME Shell extensions
GNOME Shell Extensions are add-ons that enhance the functionality and appearance of the GNOME desktop environment. Users can enable extensions for their own desktop session or for all users on the sytem.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
16.1. Enabling system-wide GNOME Shell extensions
You can automatically enable GNOME extensions for all users, eliminating the need for individual installations. Existing users with personalized extensions are not affected.
Prerequisites
Administrative access
Procedure
Download the extension archive from the GNOME Extensions website.
Extract the archive into the /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/ directory:
# unzip -q <extension-file.zip> -d /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
Replace <extension-file.zip> with the name of the extension zip file.
Adjust the permissions to ensure that the extension files are readable and executable by everyone:
# chmod -R 755 /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/<extension-directory>/
Replace <extension-directory> with the name of the extension directory.
Create a new /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-extensions file with the following content:
[org/gnome/shell]
enabled-extensions=['myextension1@myname.example.com', 'myextension2@myname.example.com']
Replace the UUIDs (myextension1@myname.example.com, myextension2@myname.example.com) with the ones you want to enable. You can find the UUID of an extension on its GNOME Shell Extensions website page.
Apply the changes to the system databases:
# dconf update
After completing these steps, the specified extensions are enabled by default for all new users on your system.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
16.2. Restricting GNOME Shell extensions
By locking down specific GNOME Shell extensions, you can ensuring that a predefined set of extensions is consistently available to all users. You can configure a set of mandatory extensions and prevent users from modifying them. The specified extensions are mandatory for all users, and the Looking Glass tool is disabled to ensure compliance with the predefined configuration.
Prerequisites
Administrative access
Procedure
Create a new /etc/dconf/db/local.d/00-extensions file with the following content:
[org/gnome/shell]
enabled-extensions=['myextension1@myname.example.com', 'myextension2@myname.example.com']
development-tools=false
Replace the UUIDs (myextension1@myname.example.com, myextension2@myname.example.com) with the ones you want to enable. You can find the UUID of an extension on its GNOME Shell Extensions website page.
To prevent users from changing these settings, create a new /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/extensions file with the following content:
/org/gnome/shell/enabled-extensions
/org/gnome/shell/development-tools
Apply the changes to the system databases:
# dconf update
Extensions that are not listed in the org.gnome.shell.enabled-extensions file are not loaded by the GNOME Shell, preventing the user from using them.
