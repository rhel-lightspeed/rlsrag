Abstract
The ipa-healthcheck utility helps administrators to detect problems in a Red Hat Identity Management (IdM) environment. This includes status checks of IdM services, configuration file permissions, replication statuses, and issues with certificates.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 1. Installing and running the IdM Healthcheck tool
Learn more about the IdM Healthcheck tool and how to install and run it.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.1. Healthcheck in IdM
The Healthcheck tool in Identity Management (IdM) helps find issues that may impact the health of your IdM environment.
Modules are Independent
Healthcheck consists of independent modules which test for:
Replication issues
Certificate validity
Certificate Authority infrastructure issues
IdM and Active Directory trust issues
Correct file permissions and ownership settings
Two output formats
Healthcheck generates the following outputs, which you can set using the output-type option:
json: Machine-readable output in JSON format (default)
human: Human-readable output
You can specify a different file destination with the --output-file option.
Results
Each Healthcheck module returns one of the following results:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.2. Installing IdM Healthcheck
Follow this procedure to install the IdM Healthcheck tool.
Procedure
Install the ipa-healthcheck package:
[root@server ~]# dnf install ipa-healthcheck
Verification
Use the --failures-only option to have ipa-healthcheck only report errors. A fully-functioning IdM installation returns an empty result of [].
[root@server ~]# ipa-healthcheck --failures-only
[]
Additional resources
Use ipa-healthcheck --help to see all supported arguments.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.3. Running IdM Healthcheck
Healthcheck can be run manually or automatically using log rotation
Prerequisites
The Healthcheck tool must be installed. See Installing IdM Healthcheck.
Procedure
To run healthcheck manually, enter the ipa-healthcheck command.
[root@server ~]# ipa-healthcheck
Additional resources
For all options, see the man page: man ipa-healthcheck.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.4. Log rotation
Log rotation creates a new log file every day, and the files are organized by date. Since log files are saved in the same directory, you can select a particular log file according to the date.
Rotation means that there is configured a number for max number of log files and if the number is exceeded, the newest file rewrites and renames the oldest one. For example, if the rotation number is 30, the thirty-first log file replaces the first (oldest) one.
Log rotation reduces voluminous log files and organizes them, which can help with analysis of the logs.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.5. Configuring log rotation using the IdM Healthcheck
Follow this procedure to configure a log rotation with:
The systemd timer
The crond service
The systemd timer runs the Healthcheck tool periodically and generates the logs. The default value is set to 4 a.m. every day.
The crond service is used for log rotation.
The default log name is healthcheck.log and the rotated logs use the healthcheck.log-YYYYMMDD format.
Prerequisites
You must execute commands as root.
Procedure
Enable a systemd timer:
# systemctl enable ipa-healthcheck.timer
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ipa-healthcheck.timer -> /usr/lib/systemd/system/ipa-healthcheck.timer.
Start the systemd timer:
# systemctl start ipa-healthcheck.timer
Open the /etc/logrotate.d/ipahealthcheck file to configure the number of logs which should be saved.
By default, log rotation is set up for 30 days.
In the /etc/logrotate.d/ipahealthcheck file, configure the path to the logs.
By default, logs are saved in the /var/log/ipa/healthcheck/ directory.
In the /etc/logrotate.d/ipahealthcheck file, configure the time for log generation.
By default, a log is created daily at 4 a.m.
To use log rotation, ensure that the crond service is enabled and running:
# systemctl enable crond
# systemctl start crond
To start with generating logs, start the IPA healthcheck service:
# systemctl start ipa-healthcheck
To verify the result, go to /var/log/ipa/healthcheck/ and check if logs are created correctly.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.6. Changing IdM Healthcheck configuration
You can change Healthcheck settings by adding the desired command line options to the /etc/ipahealthcheck/ipahealthcheck.conf file. This can be useful when, for example, you configured a log rotation and want to ensure the logs are in a format suitable for automatic analysis, but do not want to set up a new timer.
After the modification, all logs that Healthcheck creates follow the new settings. These settings also apply to any manual execution of Healthcheck.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.7. Configuring Healthcheck to change the output logs format
Follow this procedure to configure Healthcheck with a timer already set up. In this example, you configure Healthcheck to produce logs in a human-readable format and to also include successful results instead of only errors.
Prerequisites
Your system is running RHEL 9.1 or later.
You have root privileges.
You have previously configured log rotation on a timer.
Procedure
Open the /etc/ipahealthcheck/ipahealthcheck.conf file in a text editor.
Add options output_type=human and all=True to the [default] section.
Save and close the file.
Verification
Run Healthcheck manually:
# ipa-healthcheck
Go to /var/log/ipa/healthcheck/ and check that the logs are in the correct format.

Chapter 2. Checking services using IdM Healthcheck
You can monitor services used by the Identity Management (IdM) server using the Healthcheck tool.
For details, see
Healthcheck in IdM.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2.1. Services Healthcheck test
The Healthcheck tool includes a test to check if any IdM services is not running. This test is important because services which are not running can cause failures in other tests. Therefore, check that all services are running first. You can then check all other test results.
To see all services tests, run ipa-healthcheck with the --list-sources option:
# ipa-healthcheck --list-sources
You can find all services tested with Healthcheck under the ipahealthcheck.meta.services source:
certmonger
dirsrv
gssproxy
httpd
ipa_custodia
ipa_dnskeysyncd
ipa_otpd
kadmin
krb5kdc
named
pki_tomcatd
sssd
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
2.2. Screening services using Healthcheck
Follow this procedure to run a standalone manual test of services running on the Identity Management (IdM) server using the Healthcheck tool.
The Healthcheck tool includes many tests, whose results can be shortened with:
Excluding all successful test: --failures-only
Including only services tests: --source=ipahealthcheck.meta.services
Procedure
To run Healthcheck with warnings, errors and critical issues regarding services, enter:
# ipa-healthcheck --source=ipahealthcheck.meta.services --failures-only
A successful test displays empty brackets:
[ ]
If one of the services fails, the result can looks similarly to this example:
{
  "source": "ipahealthcheck.meta.services",
  "check": "httpd",
  "result": "ERROR",
  "kw": {
    "status": false,
    "msg": "httpd: not running"
  }
}

Procedure
To run Healthcheck with warnings, errors and critical issues regarding available disk space, enter:
# ipa-healthcheck --source=ipahealthcheck.system.filesystemspace --failures-only
A successful test displays empty brackets:
[]
As an example, a failed test can display:
{
  "source": "ipahealthcheck.system.filesystemspace",
  "check": "FileSystemSpaceCheck",
  "result": "ERROR",
  "kw": {
    "msg": "/var/lib/dirsrv: free space under threshold: 0 MiB < 1024 MiB",
    "store": "/var/lib/dirsrv",
    "free_space": 0,
    "threshold": 1024
  }

Chapter 6. Verifying the optimal number of KDC worker processes using IdM Healthcheck
You can use the Healthcheck tool in Identity Management (IdM) to verify that the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) is configured to use the optimal number of krb5kdc worker processes, which should be equal to the number of CPU cores on the host.
You can find the test for the correct number of KDC worker processes under the ipahealthcheck.ipa.kdc source. As the Healthcheck tool includes many tests, you can narrow down the results by including only the KDC worker tests by adding the --source ipahealthcheck.ipa.kdc option.
Prerequisites
The KDC worker process Healthcheck tool is only available on RHEL 8.7 or newer.
You must perform Healthcheck tests as the root user.
Procedure
To run the check for KDC worker processes, enter:
# ipa-healthcheck --source ipahealthcheck.ipa.kdc
If the number of KDC worker processes matches the number of CPU cores, the test returns SUCCESS as a result:
{
	"source": "ipahealthcheck.ipa.kdc",
	"check": "KDCWorkersCheck",
	"result": "SUCCESS",
	"uuid": "68f6e20a-0aa9-427d-8fdc-fbb8196d56cd",
	"when": "20230105162211Z",
	"duration": "0.000157",
	"kw": {
  	"key": "workers"
	}
}
The test returns a WARNING if the number of worker processes does not match the number of CPU cores. In the following example, a host with 2 cores is configured to have only one KDC worker process:
{
    "source": "ipahealthcheck.ipa.kdc",
    "check": "KDCWorkersCheck",
    "result": "WARNING",
    "uuid": "972b7782-1616-48e0-bd5c-49a80c257895",
    "when": "20230105122236Z",
    "duration": "0.203049",
    "kw": {
      "key": ‘workers’,
      "cpus": 2,
      "workers": 1,
      "expected": "The number of CPUs {cpus} does not match the number of workers {workers} in {sysconfig}"
    }
}
The test also outputs a WARNING if there are no configured workers. In the following example, the KRB5KDC_ARGS variable is missing from the /etc/sysconfig/krb5kdc configuration file:
  {
    "source": "ipahealthcheck.ipa.kdc",
    "check": "KDCWorkersCheck",
    "result": "WARNING",
    "uuid": "5d63ea86-67b9-4638-a41e-b71f4
56efed7",
    "when": "20230105162526Z",
    "duration": "0.000135",
    "kw": {
      "key": "workers",
      "sysconfig": "/etc/sysconfig/krb5kdc",
      "msg": "KRB5KDC_ARGS is not set in {sysconfig}"
    }
  }
