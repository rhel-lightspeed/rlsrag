Abstract
This document describes how to use GNOME, which is the only desktop environment available in RHEL 9. It explains the basics of using GNOME Shell and certain GNOME applications.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 1. Overview of GNOME environments
You can switch between several user interfaces and graphics back ends in GNOME.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.1. GNOME environments, back ends, and display protocols
In RHEL 9, there are two available GNOME environments:
GNOME Standard
GNOME Classic
Both environments can use two different protocols as their graphical back ends:
The Wayland protocol, which uses GNOME Shell as the Wayland compositor and display server.
This solution of display server is further referred as GNOME Shell on Wayland.
The X11 protocol, which uses X.Org as the display server.
The default combination in RHEL 9 is the GNOME Standard environment using GNOME Shell on Wayland as the display server. However, due to certain Wayland limitations, you might want to switch the graphics protocol stack to X11. You can also switch from GNOME Standard to GNOME Classic.
Thus, you can select from the following combinations of back ends and environments when logging in:
GNOME Shell on Wayland (the default combination in RHEL 9)
GNOME Shell on X11
GNOME Classic on Wayland
GNOME Classic on X11
Additional resources
For information about how to switch the environments, see Selecting GNOME environment and display protocol.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.2. GNOME Standard
The GNOME Standard user interface includes these major components:
The GNOME Standard desktop
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.3. GNOME Classic
GNOME Classic represents a mode for users who prefer a more traditional desktop experience that is similar to the GNOME 2 environment used with RHEL 6. It is based on GNOME 3 technologies, and at the same time it includes multiple features similar to GNOME 2.
The GNOME Classic user interface consists of these major components:
The GNOME Classic desktop with the Favorites submenu of the Applications menu
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.4. Enabling window overview in GNOME Classic
In GNOME Classic, the overview of open windows is not available by default. This procedure enables the window overview for all users on the system.
Procedure
Open the /usr/share/gnome-shell/modes/classic.json file as the root user.
Find the following line in the file:
"hasOverview": false
Change the line to the following:
"hasOverview": true
Save changes, and close the /usr/share/gnome-shell/modes/classic.json file.
Restart the user session.
Verification
In your GNOME Classic session, open multiple windows.
Press the Super key to open the window overview.
In the overview, check that:
The Dash (the horizontal panel on the bottom of the screen) is displayed.
The bottom panel is not displayed.
Window overview with "hasOverview": true
With the default settings ("hasOverview": false), the overview has the following features:
The Dash is not displayed.
The bottom panel is displayed. It includes the Window picker button in its left part and the workspace switcher in its right part.
Window overview with "hasOverview": false
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.5. Graphics back ends in RHEL 9
In RHEL 9, you can choose between two protocols to build a graphical user interface:
New installations of RHEL 9 automatically select GNOME Shell on Wayland. However, you can switch to X.Org, or select the required combination of GNOME environment and display server.
X11 applications
Client applications need to be ported to the Wayland protocol or use a graphical toolkit that has a Wayland backend, such as GTK, to be able to work natively with the compositor and display server based on Wayland.
Legacy X11 applications that cannot be ported to Wayland automatically use Xwayland as a proxy between the X11 legacy clients and the Wayland compositor. Xwayland functions both as an X11 server and a Wayland client. The role of Xwayland is to translate the X11 protocol into the Wayland protocol and reversely, so that X11 legacy applications can work with the display server based on Wayland.
On GNOME Shell on Wayland, Xwayland starts automatically at login, which ensures that most X11 legacy applications work as expected when using GNOME Shell on Wayland. However, the X11 and Wayland protocols are different, and certain clients that rely on features specific to X11 might behave differently under Xwayland. For such specific clients, you can switch to the X.Org display server.
Input devices
RHEL 9 uses a unified input stack, libinput, which manages all common device types, such as mice, touchpads, touchscreens, tablets, trackballs and pointing sticks. This unified stack is used both by the X.Org and by the GNOME Shell on Wayland compositor.
GNOME Shell on Wayland uses libinput directly for all devices, and no switchable driver support is available. Under X.Org, libinput is implemented as the X.Org libinput driver, and you can optionally enable the legacy X.Org evdev driver if libinput does not support your input device.
Additional resources
You can find the current list of environments for which Wayland is not available in the /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/61-gdm.rules file.
For additional information about the Wayland project, see Wayland documentation.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.6. Selecting GNOME environment and display protocol
The default desktop environment for RHEL 9 is GNOME Standard with GNOME Shell on Wayland as the display server. However, due to certain limitations of Wayland, you might want to switch the graphics protocol stack. You might also want to switch from GNOME Standard to GNOME Classic.
The change of GNOME environment and graphics protocol stack is persistent across user logouts, and also when powering off or rebooting the computer.
Procedure
From the login screen (GDM), click the gear button in the right bottom corner of the screen.
From the drop-down menu that appears, select the option that you prefer.
In the menu, the X.Org display server is also marked as X11.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1.7. Disabling Wayland for all users
You can disable the Wayland session for all users on the system, so that they always log in with the X11 session.
Procedure
Open the /etc/gdm/custom.conf file as the root user.
Locate the following line in the [daemon] section of the file:
#WaylandEnable=false
Uncomment the line by remove the # character. As a result, the line says:
WaylandEnable=false
Reboot the system.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Procedure
Disable the hot corner feature:
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-hot-corners false
Verification
Optionally, verify that the hot corner feature is disabled:
$ gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface enable-hot-corners

false
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
3.3. Disabling the hot corner functionality for all users
To disable the hot corner functionality for all users, you need to create a dconf profile.
Procedure
Create the user profile in the /etc/dconf/profile/user file.
user-db:user
system-db:local
Create the /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-interface file with the following content.
# Specify the dconf path
[org/gnome/desktop/interface]

# GSettings key names and their corresponding values
enable-hot-corners='FALSE'
Create a file in the /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks directory, for example /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/00-interface, with the following content.
# Prevent users from changing values for the following keys:
/org/gnome/desktop/interface/enable-hot-corners
The configuration file locks down the /org/gnome/desktop/interface/enable-hot-corners key for all users. This key controls whether the hot corner is enabled.
Update the system databases for the changes to take effect.
# dconf update
Ensure that all users log out. The changes take effect when users log back in.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Select Remove from the menu.
Verification
Check that the bookmark no longer appears in the side bar.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5.3. Renaming a bookmark
You can rename a bookmark to distinguish it from other bookmarks. If you have bookmarks to several folders that all share the same name, you can tell the bookmarks apart if you rename them.
Renaming the bookmark does not rename the folder.
Procedure
Right-click the bookmark in the side bar.
Select Rename….
In the Name field, enter the new name for the bookmark.
Click Rename.
Verification
Check that the side bar lists the bookmark under the new name.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5.4. Adding a bookmark for all users
As a system administrator, you can set a bookmark for several users at once so that file shares are easily accessible to all the users.
Procedure
In the home directory of each existing user, edit the ~user/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks file.
In the file, add a Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) line that identifies the bookmark.
For example, the following lines add bookmarks to the /usr/share/doc/ directory and to the GNOME FTP network share:
file:///usr/share/doc/
ftp://ftp.gnome.org/
Optional: To also add the bookmarks for every newly created user on the system:
Create the /etc/skel/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks file.
Enter the bookmark URI lines in the file.

Chapter 7. Enabling Chinese, Japanese, or Korean text input
If you write with Chinese, Japanese, or Korean characters, you can configure RHEL to input text in your language.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7.1. Input methods
Certain scripts, such as Chinese, Japanese, or Korean, require keyboard input to go through an Input Method Engine (IME) to enter native text.
An input method is a set of conversion rules between the text input and the selected script. An IME is a software that performs the input conversion specified by the input method.
To input text in these scripts, you must set up an IME. If you installed the system in your native language and selected your language at the GNOME Initial Setup screen, the input method for your language is enabled by default.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7.2. Available input method engines
The following input method engines (IMEs) are available on RHEL from the listed packages:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
7.3. Installing input method engines
This procedure installs input method engines (IMEs) that you can use to input Chinese, Japanese, and Korean text.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 10. Remotely accessing the desktop as a single user
You can remotely connect to the desktop on a RHEL server using graphical GNOME applications. Only a single user can connect to the desktop on the server at a given time.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
10.1. Enabling desktop sharing on the server using GNOME
This procedure configures a RHEL server to enable a remote desktop connection from a single client.
Prerequisites
The GNOME Remote Desktop service is installed:
# dnf install gnome-remote-desktop
Procedure
Configure a firewall rule to enable VNC access to the server:
# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=vnc-server
success
Reload firewall rules:
# firewall-cmd --reload
success
Open Settings in GNOME.
Navigate to the Sharing menu:
Click Screen Sharing.
The screen sharing configuration opens:
Click the switch button in the window header to enable screen sharing:
Select the Allow connections to control the screen check box.
Under Access Options, select the Require a password option.
Set a password in the Password field.
Remote clients must enter this password when connecting to the desktop on the server.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
10.2. Connecting to a shared desktop using GNOME
This procedure connects to a remote desktop session using the Connections application. It connects to the graphical session of the user that is currently logged in on the server.
Prerequisites
A user is logged into the GNOME graphical session on the server.
The desktop sharing is enabled on the server.
Procedure
Install the Connections application on the client:
# dnf install gnome-connections
Launch the Connections application.
Click the + button to open a new connection.
Enter the IP address of the server.
Choose the connection type based on the operating system you want to connect to.
Click Connect.
Verification
On the client, check that you can see the shared server desktop.
On the server, a screen sharing indicator appears on the right side of the top panel:
You can control the screen sharing in the system menu.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
10.3. Disabling encryption in GNOME VNC
You can disable encryption in the GNOME remote desktop solution. This enables VNC clients that do not support the encryption to connect to the server.
Procedure
As the server user, set the encryption key of org.gnome.desktop.remote-desktop.vnc GSettings schema to ['none'].
$ gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.remote-desktop.vnc encryption "['none']"
Optional: Red Hat recommends that you tunnel the VNC connection over SSH to your VNC port. As a result, the SSH tunnel keeps the connection encrypted.
For example:
On the client, configure the port forwarding.
# ssh -N -T -L 5901:server-ip-address:5901 user@server-ip-address
Connect to the VNC session on the localhost:5901 address.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 11. Remotely accessing the desktop as multiple users
You can remotely connect to the desktop on a RHEL server and open multiple sessions as different users at the same time.
Prerequisites
Install the VNC server:
# dnf install tigervnc-server
Install the VNC client:
# dnf install tigervnc
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
11.1. The mapping of port and display numbers to users in VNC
With VNC, the client can connect to the desktop sessions of different users on the server. A display number and a TCP port number are attached to each server user that exports a VNC session. The client uses the port number to specify which server user it connects to.
If several clients connect using the same port number, they all open a VNC session to the same server user.
You must configure a mapping for each server user that exports a VNC session. For every such user, you must pick a unique port and display number.
The recommended mapping
Red Hat recommends that you start with port number 5902 and display number 2 for the first user, and increment the numbers by one for each additional server user.
Port number 5900 and display number 0 represent the server user that is currently logged into the graphical session. You cannot start a VNC server for the user who is already logged into the graphical session.
Firewall rules
You must open the selected ports in your firewall configuration. Allowing the vnc-server service in your firewall opens ports from 5900 to 5903. If you need to enable access to additional server users, you must open ports above 5903 by manually specifying the port numbers.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
11.2. VNC server configuration files
Several configuration files affect the behavior of the VNC server. You can configure the user mapping and various global options.
General options
You can configure general options of the VNC server in the /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults configuration file. The file uses the following format:
option1=value
option2
For example:
session=gnome
alwaysshared
securitytypes=vncauth,tlsvnc
desktop=sandbox
geometry=2000x1200
The priority of configuration files
The VNC server reads the following files for general options, in order from most important to least important:
/etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-mandatory
This file replaces the default configuration and has a higher priority than the per-user configuration. It is intended for system administrators who want to enforce particular VNC options.
$HOME/.vnc/config
Individual users can override the default VNC configuration in this file.
/etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults
This file stores the default VNC configuration.
User mapping
You can configure the mapping between users and their associated port and display numbers in the /etc/tigervnc/vncserver.users configuration file. The file uses the following format:
:number=user
For example:
:2=test
:3=vncuser
Additional resources
For a list of available configuration options, see the Xvnc(1) man page.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
11.3. Enabling multi-user VNC access on the server
This procedure configures a RHEL server so that multiple users can open VNC sessions on it at the same time.
Prerequisites
If you previously configured VNC using systemd unit files, remove any outdated VNC configuration:
[root]# rm /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.service
Procedure
Map users to display and port numbers.
In the /etc/tigervnc/vncserver.users configuration file, add a line for each server user that will export a VNC session:
:user-number=user-name
Replace user-number with the port and display number mapped to the selected existing user.
Replace user-name with the user name of the selected existing user.
For example:
:2=vncuser
Open TCP ports 5900 to 5903 in the firewall:
[root]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=vnc-server
Reload the firewall rules:
[root]# firewall-cmd --reload
Add the following lines to the /etc/tigervnc/vncserver-config-defaults configuration file:
session=gnome
alwaysshared
This configuration has the following effects:
The VNC server starts the GNOME session when a remote user logs in.
Multiple users can connect to the VNC server at the same time.
As each server user that exports a VNC session, set the VNC password for the user:
[regular-user]$ vncpasswd
Remote clients must enter this password when connecting to the desktop on the server.
If you previously configured VNC for the user, ensure that the configuration files have the correct SELinux context:
[regular-user]$ restorecon -RFv ~/.vnc
Enable and start the VNC server unit for the regular user:
[root]# systemctl enable --now vncserver@:user-number
If the server uses the proprietary Nvidia driver, disable Wayland:
Uncomment the WaylandEnable=False line in the /etc/gdm/custom.conf configuration file.
Add the DefaultSession=gnome-xorg.desktop option to the [daemon] section of the configuration file.
Reboot the server.
Additional resources
To enable VNC access to more than two server users, open TCP ports above 5903. For details, see Controlling traffic with predefined services using the CLI or Controlling traffic with predefined services using the GUI.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
11.4. Connecting to the VNC server as multiple users
This procedure connects to a remote desktop session using the vncviewer application. You can open multiple connections to the remote desktop at the same time.
Prerequisites
Remote desktop access for multiple users is enabled on the server. For details, see Section 11.3, “Enabling multi-user VNC access on the server”.
Procedure
Connect to the VNC server:

Chapter 12. Remotely accessing an X11-based application
You can remotely launch a graphical X11-based application on a RHEL server and use it from the remote client using X11 forwarding.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
12.1. Enabling X11 forwarding on the server
Configure a RHEL server so that remote clients can use graphical applications on the server over SSH.
Procedure
Install basic X11 packages:
# dnf install xorg-x11-xauth xorg-x11-fonts-\* xorg-x11-utils dbus-x11
Enable the X11Forwarding option in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config configuration file:
X11Forwarding yes
The option is disabled by default in RHEL.
Restart the sshd service:
# systemctl restart sshd.service
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
12.2. Launching an application remotely using X11 forwarding
Access a graphical application on a RHEL server from a remote client using SSH.
Prerequisites
X11 forwarding over SSH is enabled on the server. For details, see Section 12.1, “Enabling X11 forwarding on the server”.
Ensure that an X11 display server is running on your system:
On RHEL, X11 is available by default in the graphical interface.
On Microsoft Windows, install an X11 server such as Xming.
On macOS, install the XQuartz X11 server.
You have configured and restarted an OpenSSH server. For details, see Configuring and starting an OpenSSH server.
Procedure
Log in to the server using SSH:
[local-user]$ ssh -X -Y remote-server

Chapter 14. Browsing files on a network share
You can connect to a network share provided by a server and browse the files on the server like local files. You can download or upload files using the file browser.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
14.1. GVFS URI format for network shares
GNOME uses the GVFS URI format to refer to network shares and files on them. When you connect to a network share from GNOME, you provide the address to the network share in the following format.
A URL, or uniform resource locator, is a form of address that refers to a location or file on a network. The address is formatted like this:
The basic GVFS URI format takes the following syntax:
protocol://server.example.com/folder/file
The scheme specifies the protocol or type of server. The example.com portion of the address is called the domain name. If a username is required, it is inserted before the server name:
You can also specify the user name or the port number to the network share:
protocol://user@server.example.com:port/folder/file
Additional resources
The GVFS system
The format of the GVFS URI string
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
14.2. Mounting a storage volume in GNOME
You can manually mount a local storage volume or a network share in the Files application.
Procedure
Open the Files application.
Click Other Locations in the side bar.
The window lists all connected storage volumes and all network shares that are publicly available on your local area network.
If you can see the volume or network share in this list, mount it by clicking the item.
If you want to connect to a different network share, use the following steps.
Enter the GVFS URI string to the network share in the Connect to Server field.
Press Connect.
If the dialog asks you for login credentials, enter your name and password into the relevant fields.
When the mounting process finishes, you can browse the files on the volume or network share.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
14.3. Unmounting a storage volume in GNOME
You can unmount a storage volume, a network share, or another resource in the Files application.
Procedure
Open the Files application.
In the side bar, click the Unmount (⏏) icon next to the chosen mount.
Wait until the mount disappears from the side bar or a notification about the safe removal appears.

Chapter 15. Configuring GNOME to store user settings on home directories hosted on an NFS share
If you use GNOME on a system with home directories hosted on an NFS server, you must change the keyfile backend of the dconf database. Otherwise, dconf might not work correctly.
This change affects all users on the host, as it alters the way dconf manages user settings and configurations stored in the home directories.
Procedure
Create the /etc/dconf/profile/user file and add the following to it:
service-db:keyfile/user
With this setting, dconf polls the keyfile back end to determine whether updates have been made, so settings might not be updated immediately.
The changes take effect when the users logs out and in.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Chapter 16. Tablets
To manage Wacom tablets connected to your system, use the following tools:
The gnome-settings-daemon service
The Wacom Tablet settings panel in the GNOME environment
The Wacom Tablet settings panel for a tablet
The Wacom Tablet settings panel for a grip pen
Both these tools, as well as the libinput stack, use the libwacom tablet client library, which stores the data about Wacom tablets.
If you want to add support for a new tablet into the libwacom library, you must ensure that a definition file for this new tablet exists.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
16.1. Preparing a tablet definition file
You must prepare a definition file for the tablet you want to add.
Prerequisites
List all local devices recognized by libwacom:
$ libwacom-list-local-devices
Make sure that your device is recognized in the output.
If your device is not listed, the device is missing from the libwacom database. However, the device might still be visible as an event device in the kernel under /proc/bus/input/devices, and if you use the X.Org display server, in the X11 session on the xinput list.
Procedure
Install the package that provides tablet definition files:
# dnf install libwacom-data
The package installs tablet definitions in the /usr/share/libwacom/ directory.
Check whether the definition file is available in the /usr/share/libwacom/ directory.
To use the screen mapping correctly, support for your tablet must be included in the libwacom database and in the udev rules file.
If the definition file for your device is not available in /usr/share/libwacom/, you have these options:
The required definition file may already be available in the linuxwacom/libwacom upstream repository. You can try to find the definition file there. If you find your tablet model in the list, copy the file to the local machine.
You can create a new tablet definition file. Use the data/wacom.example file below, and edit particular lines based on the characteristics of your device.
Example 16.1. Example model file description for a tablet
[Device]

# The product is the product name announced by the kernel

Class=Intuos4

# Exact model of the tablet, not including the size.
Model=Intuos 4 Wireless

# Width in inches, as advertised by the manufacturer
Width=9

# Height in inches, as advertised by the manufacturer
Height=6

# Optional features that this tablet supports
# Some features are dependent on the actual tool used, e.g. not all styli
# have an eraser and some styli have additional custom axes (e.g. the
# airbrush pen). These features describe those available on the tablet.
#
# Features not set in a file default to false/0

[Features]
# This tablet supports styli (and erasers, if present on the actual stylus)
Stylus=true

# This tablet supports touch.
Touch=false

# This tablet has a touch ring (Intuos4 and Cintiq 24HD)

# This tablet is built-in (most serial tablets, Cintiqs)
BuiltIn=false
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
16.2. Adding support for a new tablet
You can add support for a new tablet into the libwacom tablet information client library by adding the definition file for the tablet that you want to add.
Prerequisites
The definition file for the tablet that you want to add exists.
For more information about ensuring that the definition file exists, see Section 16.1, “Preparing a tablet definition file”.
Procedure
Add and install the definition file with the .tablet suffix:
# cp the-new-file.tablet /usr/share/libwacom/
Once installed, the tablet is part of the libwacom database. The tablet is then available through libwacom-list-local-devices.
Create a new /etc/udev/rules/99-libwacom-override.rules file with the following content so that your settings are not overwritten:
ACTION!="add|change", GOTO="libwacom_end"
KERNEL!="event[0-9]*", GOTO="libwacom_end"

[new tablet match entries go here]

LABEL="libwacom_end"
Reboot your system.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
16.4. Listing available Wacom tablet configuration paths
You can get the full list of tablet configuration paths by using the gsd-list-wacom tool, which is provided by the gnome-settings-daemon package.`
Prerequisites
Make sure that the gnome-settings-daemon package is installed on your system.
# dnf install gnome-settings-daemon
Procedure
To get the full list of tablet configuration paths used on your machine, run the following command:
$ /usr/libexec/gsd-list-wacom
